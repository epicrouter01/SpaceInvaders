Overall execution time - around 18h, as estimated.
Some tasks have taken less time, while some others a bit more. The most time consuming were the enemy movement task, because of a somewhat complex movement behavior, and Highscore task, because i had to add a separate Loading scene, just for the purpose of creating my persistent models to store my highscore data in-between-scenes. I don't think its possible to complete this project in 8 hours without skipping some of the requirements by the way. In playtika we would probably took a whole sprint for it :)
